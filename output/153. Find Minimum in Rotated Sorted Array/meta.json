    "Array was originally in ascending order. Now that the array is rotated, there would be a point in the array where there is a small deflection from the increasing sequence. eg. The array would be something like [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].",
    "You can divide the search space into two and see which direction to go.\r\nCan you think of an algorithm which has O(logN) search complexity?",
