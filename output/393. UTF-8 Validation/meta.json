    "All you have to do is follow the rules. For a given integer, obtain its binary representation in the string form and work with the rules given in the problem.",
    "An integer can either represent the start of a UTF-8 character, or a part of an existing UTF-8 character. There are two separate rules for these two scenarios in the problem.",
    "If an integer is a part of an existing UTF-8 character, simply check the 2 most significant bits of in the binary representation string. They should be <b>10</b>. If the integer represents the start of a UTF-8 character, then the first few bits would be <b>1</b> followed by a <b>0</b>. The number of initial bits (most significant) bits determines the length of the UTF-8 character. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Note:</b> The array can contain multiple valid UTF-8 characters.",
    "String manipulation will work fine here. But, it is too slow. Can we instead use <b>bit manipulation</b> to do the validations instead of string manipulations?",
    "We can use bit masking to check how many initial bits are set for a given number. <b>We only need to work with the 8 least significant bits as mentioned in the problem.</b>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nmask = 1 << 7\r\nwhile mask & num:\r\n    n_bytes += 1\r\n    mask = mask >> 1\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nCan you use bit-masking to perform the second validation as well i.e. checking if the most significant bit is 1 and the second most significant bit a 0?",
    "To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nmask1 = 1 << 7\r\nmask2 = 1 << 6\r\n\r\nif not (num & mask1 and not (num & mask2)):\r\n    return False\r\n</pre>"
