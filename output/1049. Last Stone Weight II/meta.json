    "Think of the final answer as a sum of weights with + or - sign symbols infront of each weight.  Actually, all sums with 1 of each sign symbol are possible.",
    "Use dynamic programming: for every possible sum with N stones, those sums +x or -x is possible with N+1 stones, where x is the value of the newest stone.  (This overcounts sums that are all positive or all negative, but those don't matter.)"
