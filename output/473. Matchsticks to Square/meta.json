    "Treat the matchsticks as an array. Can we split the array into 4 equal halves?",
    "Every matchstick can belong to either of the 4 sides. We don't know which one. Maybe try out all options!",
    "For every matchstick, we have to try out each of the 4 options i.e. which side it can belong to. We can make use of recursion for this.",
    "We don't really need to keep track of which matchsticks belong to a particular side during recursion. We just need to keep track of the <b>length</b> of each of the 4 sides.",
    "When all matchsticks have been used we simply need to see the length of all 4 sides. If they're equal, we have a square on our hands!"
