    "Just iterate the linked list and create copies of the nodes on the go. Since a node can be referenced from multiple nodes due to the random pointers, make sure you are not making multiple copies of the same node.",
    "You may want to use extra space to keep <b>old node ---> new node</b> mapping to prevent creating multiples copies of same node.",
    "We can avoid using extra space for old node ---> new node mapping, by tweaking the original linked list. Simply interweave the nodes of the old and copied list. \r\nFor e.g.\r\n<pre>\r\nOld List: A --> B --> C --> D\r\nInterWeaved List: A --> A' --> B --> B' --> C --> C' --> D --> D'\r\n</pre>",
    "The interweaving is done using <b>next</b> pointers and we can make use of interweaved structure to get the correct reference nodes for <b>random</b> pointers."
