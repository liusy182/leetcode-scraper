    "We can think of this problem as a shortest path problem on a graph: there are `10000` nodes (strings `'0000'` to `'9999'`), and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ in one digit, that digit differs by 1 (wrapping around, so `'0'` and `'9'` differ by 1), and if *both* nodes are not in `deadends`."
