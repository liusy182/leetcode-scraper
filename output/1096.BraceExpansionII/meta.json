    "You can write helper methods to parse the next \"chunk\" of the expression.  If you see eg. \"a\", the answer is just the set {a}.  If you see \"{\", you parse until you complete the \"}\" (the number of { and } seen are equal) and that becomes a chunk that you find where the appropriate commas are, and parse each individual expression between the commas."
